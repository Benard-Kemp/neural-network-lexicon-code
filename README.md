# Neural Network Lexicon — PyTorch Implementation Library

This repository contains the official **PyTorch reference implementations** for concepts explained in the **Neural Network Lexicon**.

Each folder corresponds to a specific lexicon entry and provides:

- Clean, minimal, runnable PyTorch code
- Educational, readable implementations
- Direct mapping between theory and practice
- Supporting files for experimentation and learning

This repository is designed to answer one critical question:

> "How does this neural network concept actually work in code?"

---

# Main Lexicon Website

Each lexicon entry links directly to its corresponding implementation in this repository.

# Design Philosophy

This repository follows five core principles:

## 1. Minimal

No unnecessary abstractions.

The goal is understanding, not production engineering.

---

## 2. Runnable Anywhere

Examples run on:

- CPU
- No GPU required
- No external datasets required

---

## 3. Concept-Focused

Each script demonstrates exactly one concept.

Examples avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

## 4. Educational Clarity

Code prioritizes:

- Readability
- Explicitness
- Learning value

Over performance optimization.

---

## 5. Direct Mapping to Lexicon Entries

Every script directly corresponds to a Neural Network Lexicon concept.
